# Consciousness_detection
This project presents an algorithm that detects consciousness based on human mobility using AI and image processing techniques using visible (RGB) and infrared imaging (IRT).

This project was developed using Python 3.7 and it uses the open source Mask-RCNN developed by He et al.


## Method
Example of the mobility classification of one RGB video. ![This is an image](https://github.com/dddqqq/Consciousness_detection/blob/main/Figure%203.png)
